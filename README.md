# Hi, I'm Clarissa Fuller 👋

Technically curious problem-solver with a background in chemistry and growing experience in computer science, data, and software systems.

I build projects to strengthen my understanding of backend logic, data modeling, and practical system design. I'm especially interested in roles that sit at the intersection of technology, data, and real-world operations.
